This is a demo widget for the Ripple Mobile Environment Emulator. The widget itself resides in /public and is by default configured for the JIL 1.2.x SDK & Emulator.

It showcases various features within Ripple's environment and provides a quick introduction to Ripple and examples of various platform API calls that it supports.

Currently the demo widget focuses on JIL specific API calls but will be extended to demos for all supported platforms.
